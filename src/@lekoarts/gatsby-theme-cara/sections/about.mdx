## Our team

While our team has garnered invaluable experience from pioneering companies such as Justfly/Flighthub, Epic Games and Google, we became consultants because we believe we can have a greater impact bringing your unique ideas to life. We understand that communication and good analytical skills are essential to bring any project to success, but our experience has also shown us how to move fast while doing it.

>Our expertise includes

- Building responsive, snappy web apps that work well in all modern browsers.
- Developing and integrating APIs securely and robustly.
- Deploying infrastructure that scales with your success.
- Designing, optimizing and maintaining large and small databases.
- Search engine optimization.
- Making data-driven decisions, especially when it comes to driving sales.
- Creating and/or following designer mock-ups and requirement specifications to the T.
- Project management and prioritization.

In the past year, we've also worked with ambitious startups on:

- Light machine learning and AI projects.
- Mobile applications that perform equally well on Android and iOS.
